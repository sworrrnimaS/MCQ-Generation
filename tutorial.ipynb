    "text = '''Organic chemistry is a branch of chemistry that focuses on the study of carbon-containing compounds and their properties, structures, and reactions. Carbon's unique ability to form stable bonds with other carbon atoms and a wide variety of elements, including hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens, results in an immense diversity of organic compounds. These compounds range from simple molecules like methane (CH₄) to complex macromolecules such as proteins and DNA, which are essential to life. A central concept in organic chemistry is the functional group, which is a specific grouping of atoms within a molecule that imparts characteristic chemical reactivity and properties. Common functional groups include hydroxyl groups (-OH), carboxyl groups (-COOH), amino groups (-NH₂), and many others. Organic reactions often involve the making and breaking of bonds within these functional groups, leading to the synthesis of new compounds. The study of organic chemistry is crucial for many industries, including pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and agriculture. It plays a key role in the development of new medications, synthetic fibers, plastics, and other materials. Organic chemists employ a variety of techniques, such as spectroscopy and chromatography, to analyze and characterize compounds, allowing for the precise manipulation of molecular structures to achieve desired chemical outcomes. This field continues to evolve, driving innovations that impact many aspects of modern life.'''\n",
